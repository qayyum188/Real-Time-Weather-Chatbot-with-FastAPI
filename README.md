# Realtime Weather Chatbot

This project implements an AI-powered chatbot integrated with a FastAPI backend, designed to provide weather-related information in real time. The chatbot interacts with users, answering questions about weather conditions for cities worldwide.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Chatbot**: Utilizes WebSocket communication for real-time interactions.
- **Weather Queries**: Users can ask for temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
- **FastAPI Backend**: Lightweight and efficient backend with robust API endpoints.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly web interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Function Handling**: Used function handling by implementing a dynamic `function_map` dictionary that allows flexible, runtime routing of method calls with type-safe, modular execution.
